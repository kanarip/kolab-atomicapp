## The IMAP Reverse Proxy

This is an IMAP Reverse Proxy for Kolab Groupware.

It prevents clients that do not understand how to represent the
contents of those IMAP folders that contain groupware data from reading
and/or obtaining those very folders.

It also bridges the gap between SPECIAL-USE clients and Kolab clients,
whom may otherwise have to consider data in desync.
